# ![app icon](./.github/readme-images/app-icon.png)Tachiyomi

Changes to Tachiyomi in early January 2020 made it no longer useable with Android 4.x.  This fork is based off the last point before that change.  Don't expect many updates or upgrades--maintenance will be the main focus.  Again, to be clear, you should only be using this version of Tachiyomi if you're on Android 4.x; otherwise you should be using Tachiyomi's dev build or one of the other Tachiyomi forks.

Tachiyomi is a free and open source manga reader for Android.
